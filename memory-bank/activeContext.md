## Current Work Focus

As of March 29, 2025, we have created a modern, responsive website for the Islamic Society of Sheboygan using Jekyll and Netlify. Our most recent focus has been on implementing several content updates and feature enhancements, including updating the prayer times functionality, integrating EmailJS for contact form submissions, creating a dedicated donations page, updating the About Us content, and migrating from GitHub Pages to Netlify for better CMS integration.

   - Test EmailJS contact form functionality

3. **Analytics Integration**:

   - Create custom dashboard for site administrators

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **EmailJS Integration**: We chose EmailJS over Formspree or Netlify Forms for the contact form because it works well with static sites hosted on GitHub Pages while providing a better user experience with no page redirects after form submission.

2. **Prayer Times Display**: We simplified the prayer times section by removing the monthly schedule, focusing instead on the daily prayer times which update automatically.

3. **Donation Integration**: We implemented a simple PayPal donation button rather than a more complex payment processing system to maintain simplicity and security.

4. **Netlify Identity and Git Gateway**: We chose Netlify Identity over GitHub OAuth for CMS authentication because it provides a more streamlined user experience, doesn't require users to have GitHub accounts, and integrates seamlessly with Netlify's Git Gateway service.

### Design Considerations

1. **Mobile-First**: The site is designed with mobile users as the primary audience, with progressive enhancement for larger screens.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Design choices reflect the religious nature of the organization with appropriate imagery, color schemes, and typography.

3. **Accessibility**: We're working to ensure the site meets WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

## Current Environment

- **Ruby Version**: 3.4.2 (via Homebrew)
- **Jekyll Version**: 4.3.4
- **Development Platform**: macOS
- **Primary Test Browser**: Chrome

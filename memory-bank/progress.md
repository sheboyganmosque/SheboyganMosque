## Current Status

The project is in a functional development state with core features implemented. The site can run locally and demonstrates the main functionality. Recent updates include:

1. Removing the monthly prayer times section from the prayer times page
2. Setting up the EmailJS integration for the contact form
3. Creating a dedicated donation page with PayPal button
4. Updating the About Us page with new concise content and leadership team information
5. Migrating from GitHub Pages to Netlify hosting for improved CMS functionality
6. Implementing Netlify Identity and Git Gateway for secure admin access

It's ready for Netlify deployment as a minimum viable product, but would benefit from the additional content and refinements listed above.

## Known Issues

1. **Prayer Times API**: May encounter rate limiting if traffic grows substantially
2. **Placeholder Images**: Need to be replaced with actual images
3. **EmailJS Configuration**: Needs actual service ID, template ID, and public key from an EmailJS account
4. **Ruby Dependencies**: Some warnings about future Ruby versions removing libraries
5. **Mock Data**: Some prayer times and event data is still using mock data

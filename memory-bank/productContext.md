# Product Context for Islamic Society of Sheboygan Website

## Why This Project Exists

The Islamic Society of Sheboygan website project exists to replace an outdated website with a modern, feature-rich platform that better serves the mosque's community and visitors. The previous website had limited functionality, outdated design, and wasn't optimized for mobile devices. Additionally, it lacked a content management system, making updates difficult for non-technical staff.

## Problems This Project Solves

1. **Outdated Information**: The previous site had limited ability to publish timely updates. The new site includes a blog system and content management interface to keep information current.

2. **Prayer Time Management**: Previously, prayer times may have been manually updated. The new site automatically calculates and displays accurate prayer times using the Aladhan API with proper timezone handling.

3. **Limited Event Communication**: The previous site had no robust way to announce and manage events. The new site features a comprehensive events system with recurring event support.

4. **Technical Barriers to Updates**: Non-technical staff had difficulty updating content. With Netlify CMS integration, content managers can now easily update the site without technical knowledge.

5. **Mobile Experience**: The previous site wasn't fully responsive. The new site is built with Bootstrap 5 to ensure an optimal experience across all devices.

6. **Community Engagement**: Previous site lacked features to engage the community. The new site includes blog posts, event registration, and other engagement tools.

## How It Should Work

The website functions as a static site generated by Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages. Content managers interact with Netlify CMS at the `/admin` endpoint to update content without needing to understand technical details of site management.
